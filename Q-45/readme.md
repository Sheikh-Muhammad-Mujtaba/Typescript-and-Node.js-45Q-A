# Q45:- Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

## Answer:
```typescript
// Define the interface for the car object
interface Car {
    manufacturer: string;
    model: string;
    [key: string]: any;  // Index signature to accept arbitrary properties
}

// Function to create a car object
function createCar(manufacturer: string, model: string, additionalInfo?: { [key: string]: any }): Car {
    // Create the car object with required properties
    const car: Car = {
        manufacturer,
        model,
        ...additionalInfo  // Spread the additional properties
    };
    
    return car;
}

// Example usage of the function
const car1 = createCar('Toyota', 'Corolla', { color: 'blue', year: 2020 });
const car2 = createCar('Honda', 'Civic', { color: 'red', sunroof: true });

// Print the car objects to verify the information
console.log(car1);
console.log(car2);

```
